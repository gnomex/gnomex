## Kenner Kliemann
  I'm a learner and passionate on problem solving with technologies. Specially if I can craft/hack/optimize some **interesting/fun** code

- :rocket: currently working at **Inteligov**
- :hammer_and_wrench: always learning and crafting techs
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about linux, ruby, rails, javascript, techs... Science, nutrition, plants, gardening, consciousness, the meaning of life, universe and all things
